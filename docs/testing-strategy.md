# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Lynx RBAC Project. It covers the different types of tests, tools, and frameworks used, as well as guidelines for writing and running tests.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are used to test individual components or functions in isolation. They ensure that each unit of the codebase works as expected.

- **Tools**: Jest, ts-jest
- **Location**: `backend/src/**/*.spec.ts`, `frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are used to test the interaction between different components or modules. They ensure that the integrated parts of the application work together correctly.

- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest
- **Location**: `backend/src/**/*.int.spec.ts`, `frontend/src/**/*.int.test.tsx`

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are used to test the entire application from the user's perspective. They ensure that the application works as a whole and meets the requirements.

- **Tools**: Cypress
- **Location**: `frontend/cypress/integration/**/*.spec.ts`

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Backend

- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration tests.
- **ts-jest**: A TypeScript preprocessor for Jest.
- **Supertest**: A library for testing HTTP endpoints.

### Frontend

- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration tests.
- **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components.
- **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework.

## Writing Tests

### Guidelines

1. **Write tests for all new features and bug fixes**: Ensure that every new feature and bug fix is covered by tests.
2. **Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern**: Structure your tests using the AAA pattern to make them more readable and maintainable.
3. **Use descriptive test names**: Write test names that clearly describe the purpose of the test.
4. **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocking libraries to mock external dependencies and isolate the unit under test.

### Examples

#### Unit Test (Backend)

```typescript
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { JwtService } from '@nestjs/jwt';

describe('AuthService', () => {
  let authService: AuthService;
  let jwtService: JwtService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    jwtService = new JwtService();
    authService = new AuthService(jwtService);
  });

  it('should generate a JWT token', () => {
    const user = { id: 1, username: 'testuser' };
    const token = authService.generateToken(user);
    expect(token).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

#### Unit Test (Frontend)

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Auth from './Auth';

test('renders login form', () => {
  render(<Auth />);
  const loginElement = screen.getByText(/login/i);
  expect(loginElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Running Tests

### Backend

To run the backend tests, use the following command:

```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

### Frontend

To run the frontend tests, use the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run cypress:open
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline runs the tests on every push and pull request to ensure that the codebase remains stable.

### Configuration

The CI configuration file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It includes steps for installing dependencies, running tests, and reporting the results.

## Conclusion

By following this testing strategy, we can ensure that the Lynx RBAC Project remains reliable, maintainable, and free of bugs. Writing and running tests regularly will help us catch issues early and deliver a high-quality product.
