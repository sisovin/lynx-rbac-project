# Roles and Permissions

## Overview

In this document, we will cover the roles and permissions system implemented in the Lynx RBAC Project. This system allows for fine-grained control over user access and actions within the application.

## Roles

Roles are a way to group permissions together. Each role can have multiple permissions, and each user can be assigned one or more roles. Roles can also be hierarchical, meaning that a role can inherit permissions from another role.

### Role Management

- **Create Role**: Allows the creation of a new role.
- **Update Role**: Allows updating the details of an existing role.
- **Delete Role**: Allows deleting an existing role.
- **Assign Role**: Allows assigning a role to a user.

## Permissions

Permissions define specific actions that can be performed within the application. Permissions can be assigned to roles, and users inherit permissions through their assigned roles.

### Permission Management

- **Create Permission**: Allows the creation of a new permission.
- **Update Permission**: Allows updating the details of an existing permission.
- **Delete Permission**: Allows deleting an existing permission.
- **Assign Permission**: Allows assigning a permission to a role.

## Hierarchical Roles

Hierarchical roles allow for a role to inherit permissions from another role. This is useful for creating a structure where higher-level roles automatically have the permissions of lower-level roles.

### Example

- **Admin**: Has all permissions.
- **Manager**: Inherits permissions from the "User" role and has additional management permissions.
- **User**: Has basic permissions for using the application.

## Implementation Details

### Roles

Roles are implemented using the `Role` entity and managed through the `RolesService` and `RolesController`.

### Permissions

Permissions are implemented using the `Permission` entity and managed through the `PermissionsService` and `PermissionsController`.

### Database Schema

The database schema includes tables for roles, permissions, and the relationships between them. The schema is managed using Drizzle ORM.

### API Endpoints

- **Roles**
  - `POST /roles`: Create a new role.
  - `GET /roles`: Retrieve all roles.
  - `GET /roles/:id`: Retrieve a specific role by ID.
  - `PUT /roles/:id`: Update a specific role by ID.
  - `DELETE /roles/:id`: Delete a specific role by ID.

- **Permissions**
  - `POST /permissions`: Create a new permission.
  - `GET /permissions`: Retrieve all permissions.
  - `GET /permissions/:id`: Retrieve a specific permission by ID.
  - `PUT /permissions/:id`: Update a specific permission by ID.
  - `DELETE /permissions/:id`: Delete a specific permission by ID.

## Conclusion

The roles and permissions system in the Lynx RBAC Project provides a flexible and powerful way to manage user access and actions within the application. By using roles and permissions, you can ensure that users have the appropriate level of access and control over the application's features and functionality.
